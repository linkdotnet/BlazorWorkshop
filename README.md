# Blazor Worksop
Welcome to the Blazor Worksop. In this README you will find all the necessary information to get started.

## Setup
What do we need?

 - .NET Core 3.1 from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
	 - After installation open a command line and type in the following:
	 - > dotnet --list-runtimes
	 - > dotnet --list-sdks
	 - It should print out information about the installed SDK's and its versions
	 - The important runtimes are: Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.8 and Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.8

 - On the same site you will find the Installer for ASP.NET Core 3.1.
 - Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio 2019 running (16.7.5 or higher)

## Tasks
This workshop has various tasks which are split up to different branches.
Use your IDE or the git's switch command to switch between branches.
There is also a Tests project which should get green if the component is correctly implemented.
Just run `dotnet test` or use your IDE to run the Unit test and see if you could do the task.
